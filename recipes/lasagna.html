    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="lasagna.jpeg"/>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>  
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken) ;</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated ;</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese ;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
