    <p>Super simple and delicious Creamy Garlic Penne Pasta recipe packed with flavor. This dish is perfect by itself or you can add chicken too!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>  
        <li>penne pastaa</li>
        <li>whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>spring onion</li>
        <li>cheddar chesse</li>
        <li>chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a saucepan. Keep the heat to low and add 2 tablespoons butter. You can use salted or unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>When the butter melts and starts to bubble, add 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour (atta) or choose to swap 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida) with the whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>Using a wired whisk, stir the flour quickly as soon as you add it. Keep stirring so that no lumps are formed. The frequent stirring helps the flour to cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Keep heat on low and pour 1 cup cold or chilled milk in a gentle stream with one hand and stir the sauce mixture with the other.</li>
        <li>Stir frequently, while the milk heats up.</li>
        <li>On low heat, simmer the sauce till it thickens. When the sauce has thickened well and coats the back of a spoon, turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and place on the kitchen countertop.</li>
        <li>Mix very well and set aside. Keep in mind that the sauce will thicken as it cools, so keep the consistency accordingly.</li>
        <li>Boil 4 cups water with ½ teaspoon salt in a pan.</li>
        <li>When the water comes to a boil, add 1 cup penne pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta on a medium to high heat.</li>
        <li>When the pasta gets done to an al dente texture, turn off the heat. For a more softer texture, cook the pasta a little longer. Strain the pasta with a large strainer spoon.</li>
        <li>Then, add the cooked penne pasta to the prepared white sauce.</li>
        <li>Add ¼ teaspoon each of dried oregano, dried basil and dried thyme. Or add your choice of herbs.</li>
        <li>Mix very well.</li>
        <li>Serve White Sauce Pasta garnished with some fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro, basil, chives or dill. You can also garnish with some grated cheddar cheese.</li>
    </ol>
